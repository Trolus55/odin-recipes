    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball Artisan Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>Semolina flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Basic Pizza Sauce (recipe follows)</li>
        <li>3 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or oregano leaves, for garnishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Let chilled covered dough stand at room temperature until dough is cool (not cold) and a fingerprint remains when dough is pressed, 1 to 2 hours. Transfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured surface. Using floured fingertips, firmly press all over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border.</li>
        <li>If cooking in your home oven, preheat to 500Â°F with a baking steel or large round cast-iron pizza pan (such as Lodge 15-inch) on middle rack.</li>
        <li>Form a C-shape with the outer edge of your hand, and press firmly inside dough border to define a 1/2-inch wide ring around edge of dough.</li>
        <li>Lift dough onto the knuckles of both hands, and gently stretch, rotating dough after each stretch to maintain its round shape.</li>
        <li>Continue gently stretching dough, allowing gravity to help it expand, until a 10-inch circle of even thickness forms, with a slightly thicker outer ring.</li>
        <li>Top with shredded mozzarella.</li>
    </ol>
